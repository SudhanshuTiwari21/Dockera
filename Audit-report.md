## 2. Premium Feel UX Recommendations

### Layout & Hierarchy
- **Single-column focus:** One primary CTA per screen. Avoid two-column layouts on mobile.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Hide "Advanced" (DPI, metadata, compression level) behind a toggle. Default: simple mode.
- **Clear typography:** H1 = tool name. Subtitle = one-line benefit. No marketing fluff.
- **Generous whitespace:** 24–32px between sections. Avoid dense forms.

### Interactions
- **Soft animations:** 150–200ms transitions on hover/focus. Subtle scale on button hover.
- **Skeleton loading:** Replace spinners with skeleton placeholders for preview areas.
- **Live size feedback:** As user selects file → show original size immediately. After processing → show before/after with delta.
- **Floating action button:** "Download" as a sticky FAB after result is ready (mobile).
- **Micro-interactions:** Checkmark on successful processing. Subtle pulse on upload zone when dragging.

### Trust & Polish
- **"Processed locally. Never uploaded."** — Prominent, consistent badge. Consider icon + short text.
- **Dark mode:** Full support. Slate/neutral palette. No harsh contrast.
- **Responsive mobile-first:** Upload zone 100% width. Buttons full-width on small screens. Touch-friendly hit areas (min 44px).

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard support:** Tab through controls. Enter to submit. Escape to clear.
- **Contrast:** WCAG AA. Ensure error states (red) meet contrast.
- **Focus visible:** Clear focus ring on focusable elements.
- **Screen reader:** `aria-live` for processing status. Descriptive button labels.

## 9. Final Prioritized Roadmap

### Top 10 — Build Now (No API / No Infra)

*Client-side or simple backend. High impact, low investment.*

1. **Exam Preset Selector** — Dropdown SSC, UPSC, RRB, IBPS. Auto-sets KB, dimensions. Shared across tools.
2. **Image reordering in Image to PDF** — Drag-and-drop reorder.
3. **Merge PDF drag-and-drop reordering** — Reorder files before merge.
4. **Drag-and-drop upload** — Replace/supplement file input. Table stakes.
5. **Side-by-side before/after** — Image Resizer, Compress, Signature. Visual confidence.
6. **Background auto-white (Passport Photo)** — Canvas-based level/curve adjustment. No AI.
7. **Cropping ratio lock** — Lock 3.5:4.5, 1:1 in Passport Photo.
8. **Real-time size estimator** — "Est. output: ~48 KB" before processing.
9. **"Upload Error Fix Mode"** — Parse error text, suggest tool + action. Client-side rules.
10. **Trust badge consistency** — "Processed locally. Never uploaded." on every tool.

### Mid-Term — Still Client-Side / Light Backend

- Batch processing (2–5 files free) — client-side loop.
- PDF compressor: target size + compression level.
- Signature clarity enhancer — contrast/levels (Canvas), no AI.
- Saved presets (1 free) — localStorage.
- Progressive disclosure for advanced settings.

### Future — When Revenue / PMF Justifies

- Signature sharpening (AI)
- Download history
- Account storage
- Faster queue

## Summary

DocMint’s niche advantage comes from **precision**, **speed**, **trust**, and **exam-specific intelligence**. The audit prioritizes:

**Build now:** Client-side features (exam presets, reorder UX, before/after, ratio lock, trust badge). No API or infra.

**Future:** AI (background removal, signature deblur), backend storage, download history, email, OCR, server queues. Revisit when PMF or revenue justifies the investment.

Avoid feature overload. Ship one high-impact item at a time. Quality over quantity.
